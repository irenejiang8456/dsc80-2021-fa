    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs and programming assignments will be graded in (at most) two ways:\n",
    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying python file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",
    "2. The notebook may be graded (if it contains free response questions or asks you to draw plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Labs will have public tests and private tests. The public \"smoke tests\" that you will run below and which appear on Gradescope are generally worth no points. After the due date, we will replace these tests with private tests that will determine your grade. This is different from DSC 10, where labs only had public tests!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",
    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name.\n",
    "- If you changed something you weren't supposed to, just use git to revert! Ask us if you need help with this, or google around for `git revert`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for working in the Notebook**:\n",
    "- The notebooks serve to present the questions and give you a place to present your results for later review.\n",
    "- The notebook on *lab assignments* are not graded (only the `.py` file).\n",
    "- Notebooks for *projects* will serve as a final report for the assignment, and contain conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",
    "- The notebook serves as a nice environment for 'pre-development' and experimentation before designing your function in your `.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the .py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for developing in the .py file**:\n",
    "- Do not change the function names in the starter code; grading is done using these function names.\n",
    "- Do not change the docstrings in the functions. These are there to tell you if your work is on the right track!\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",
    "    - You may write your other functions in an additional `.py` file that you import in `lab.py` (much like we do in the notebook).\n",
